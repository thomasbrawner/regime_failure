This repository will host several Python and R scripts, as well as IPython Notebooks and RMarkdown documents, demonstrating data management and analysis related to the breakdown of authoritarian regimes. Additions are made as they become available. Comments and questions are encouraged.

- `gwf_democracies.py`: this script executes variable construction for the proportion of democratic states in the geographic neighborhood surrounding authoritarian countries.
